                    <p>
                        CSSA mainly consists of Chinese students and scholars from different areas in China. We tried to make all Chinese students united and establish more friendships. The stated function of CSSAs is helping away-from-home Chinese in their life, study, work, and other issues, to bring Chinese students together on campus, serving as a bridge between the Chinese and other communities, and spreading Chinese culture. The groups typically host events such as annual Chinese New Year galas, holiday celebrations as well as academic forums and talent recruitment competitions tied to the Thousand Talents Plan.
